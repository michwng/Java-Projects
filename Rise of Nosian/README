This project was created in the Visual Studio Code IDE.
This project was started on October 25th, 2021 and is currently in development. 
This project is a freelance project for the sole purpose of brushing up on Java skills.

This game strongly draws inspiration from:
- Sonny & Sonny 2 (Flash Games)
- Fire Emblem series
- Dungeon of Despair/Sigian Conflict

This project has Audio! Be sure to turn down your volume to the right amount.

All classes except SimpleAudioPlayer are created by Michael Ng.
SimpleAudioPlayer was originally created by geeksforgeeks.org.
I have modified SimpleAudioPlayer to fit the project's needs.
