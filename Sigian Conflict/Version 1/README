This is Sigian Conflict!
This game was made in the Eclipse IDE, starting on March 28, 2021. This game was completed on April 11th, 2021.
This is a solo (indie) project. This project was made as part of my Introduction to Computer Science II Course at ETSU.

Sigian Conflict is a Java RPG, but offers a different environment and mechanics when compared to my first project, The Dungeon of Despair.
