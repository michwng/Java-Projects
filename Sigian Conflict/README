This is Sigian Conflict!
This game was made in the Eclipse IDE, starting on March 28, 2021. This game was completed on April 11th, 2021.
This is a solo (indie) project. This project was made as part of my Introduction to Computer Science II Course at ETSU.

Sigian Conflict is a Java RPG, but offers a different environment and mechanics when compared to my first project, The Dungeon of Despair.

===========================
======= VERSION LOG =======
===========================
The Version Log tracks any changes made to the game since its release in Version 1.0.

Version 1.0 - The original submitted project.
    Created March 28, 2021 - Submitted May 21, 2021


Version 1.5 (Anniversary Update)
    - Small note: the UML Diagram and Design Document still reflect Version 1.0.

    *** IMPORTANT ADDITIONS ***
    - Added Skirmish Mode. 
        - Skirmish Mode allows the player to customize their own battle.
        - You can:
            - Change the Battlefield Width and Length
            - Change the Number of Enemies on the Battlefield
            - Change the Sparseness of Enemies on the Battlefield
            - Change the Item Spawn Rate of Items on the Battlefield

    - A new boss, Rebellious Warlord, has been added as the last enemy of the Skirmish.
        - Beware his rocket launcher... It can shoot many rockets at once.

    *** BUG FIXES ***
    - Fixed the Sharpshooter skill to accurately ignore armor.
        - However, the skill will only ignore up to 30% of the enemy's armor.

    - All Special Skills were mistakenly advertised as having the ability to ignore enemy armor.
        - Only the Sharpshooter and Weak Point Special Skills are capable of such.
        - The descriptions of the skills has been updated to reflect this change.
    
    - The Critical Hit Special Skill is buffed by improving luck by 65% per shot (before: 50%).
    - The Triple Hit Special Skill is replaced with the "Weak Point" Special Skill.
        - Weak Point combines the effects of Sharpshooter and Critical Hit by ignoring up to 25% of enemy armor and increasing luck by 40% per shot.

    - The text displayed after ignoring the armor has been updated to reflect this change.

    - Attacking when the gun's clip is less than the RPS shows that the gun fired [RPS] amount of bullets.
        - For example, using unload with a weapon with 14 / 20 clip and 20 RPS will say that the hero fired 20 bullets.
        - The bug has been fixed and the battle menu has been altered to reflect this change.

    - A similar issue of the above bug is apparent with Special Skills as well, particularly with the Special Skill Unload.
        - This issue has been addressed and resolved as well, in this version.

    *** EASE OF PLAY ***
    - The enemies encountered per chapter battle has been reduced in light of repetitive gameplay.
        - The number of enemies in Chapter 0 are reduced from 5 to 3. 
        - The number of enemies in Chapter 1 are reduced from 8 to 4. 
        - The number of enemies in Chapter 2 are reduced from 5 to 4. 
        - The number of enemies in Chapter 3 are reduced from 10 to 5. 
        - The number of enemies in Chapter 4 are reduced from 12 to 6. 
        - The number of enemies in Chapter 5 are reduced from 10 to 7. 

    - Enemies drop slightly more Experience to account for less enemies.
        
    Version 1.5 was edited and submitted on May 29, 2022.
